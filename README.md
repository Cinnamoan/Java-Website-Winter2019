# Java-Website-Winter2019
This was a project that had five deliverables (Web Development - Enterprise: WEBD4201) sporadically spread out in my thrid semester. In here I integrated my knowledge on Java and Javascript to create and maintain a website (hosted by Apache Tomcat). The website's purpose is to calculate a student's GPA based on the cumulative weight of the courses and the grade they obtained on them.
